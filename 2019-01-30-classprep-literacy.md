In "Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming  is Changing Writing," Annette Vee writes:

>"Programming and writing are both socially inflicted by the contexts in which they are learned and circulated and are materially shaped by the technologies that support and distribute them." (3)

What immediately comes to mind is Marshall McLuhan's “The Medium is the Message,” that the content is shaped and informed by its container, to such an extent that the container itself becomes content. Vee explores the implications of "literacy," as a medium, and its "association with moral goodness and economic success," (3). In Ellen Cushman's piece, "We're Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century," she writes about Cherokee literacy, and how the figure Sequoyah saw and affected shifting literacies in his time. The example of Sequoyah, who was both literate in English and in the Cherokee writing system which he developed, demonstrates Vee's idea of literacy being based in historical contexts.  

According to Cushman, Sequoyah saw "the importance of English literacy...witnessing an era of increasing social change due in part to the influence of outsiders and their writing technologies." For Sequoyah, having English literacy was a utility, and having Cherokee literacy was an act of "cultural perserverance." This duality is not unlike the kind Vee writes about, between writing literacy and computational literacy. We see more an more the increasing usefulness and importance of coding, in all sorts of jobs fields and contexts. Learning to code should be considered a survival tool in the digital world. But maintaining writing literacy is equally as important, a matter of culture. We are at a watershed moment, where there is a palpable push and pull between computation and the humanities. But these literacies can and should exist together, and even shape each other.
