#The Medium is the Message

In “The Medium is the Message,” Marshall McLuhan offers an interesting take on a concern of many media scholars, which is to consider and analyze not only the content of a medium, but the medium itself. Because the medium is singularly is as meaningful as the information it is explicitly delivering, as McLuhan claims, “the ‘content’ of any medium is always another medium,” (8). This suggestion evokes a kind of Russian nesting doll consisting of *content* and *container*, a notion that is, paradoxically, both inescapable and somewhat contrived.  
To help think through this, I tried to apply this to one of my favorite shows, *Arrested Development*. While on the surface, the show centers around the personal story of one Michael Bluth, the meaning of the narrative would be incomplete without considering how Michael is contained within the medium of his dysfunctional family. Going further, Michael and his family are also contained within the medium of a television sitcom. At this level, the meaning is enriched by the ironic subversion of naturalized tropes within the sitcome meadium.  
Each level calls upon different elements of the “cultural matrix” (McLuhan, 11) which add meaning to the presented content. But what troubles me is how far McLuhan’s Russian nesting doll can go. As the media on each level becomes more macro as we pull back from the original content, just how important, and how accessible, can these planes of meaning be? Here, I’ll offer an idea from Lisa Gitelman’s *Media as Historical Subjects*. She writes: 

>“The success of all media depends at some level on inattention or ‘blindness’ to the media technologies themselves (and all of their supporting protocols) in favor of attention to the phenomena, ‘the content,’that they represent for users’ edification or enjoyment.” (Gitelman, 6)

Essentially, despite all of the attentions that could be paid to each level of the nesting doll, as all as the considerations that no doubt involved with the creation of media and content (as well as protocols, as Gitelman explains), the consumer of the media need not dwell on each level, but rather accept the self-evident meaning of the entire package.
