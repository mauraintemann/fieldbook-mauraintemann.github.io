Before Gutenberg's printing press revolutionized media and communications, the production and copying of books and codicies were largely the work of scribes. This work was manual, often physically grueling, as evidenced by notes writen by scribes in the margines of their work: "It crooks your back, it dims your sight, it twists your stomach and your sides." But the work of scibes was also intrinsically tied to a kind of intellectual labor -- a sacred form of devotion that went beyond simply copying letters. 

Similarly, in print culture of the 19th century, a parallel connection between the physcial and intellectual labor of typesetting and printing was central to the trade. 

In Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, he writes about his early life while he was working as a printer. Here, he visits a print-house in Philidelphia, but is unimpressed with the quality of the establishment:

>"These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business. Bradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer, tho' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of presswork."

Printing not only demanded physical strength and dexterity, but required some baseline literacy, even a scholarly mind. 

Today, the intellectual and creative work of writing seems to be more divorced from the physcial processes and technologies that allow media to function. As I write on my computer, I'm not thinking about the hardware that's making the words show up on my screen or the technology that lets me upload my work to my repository. Similarly, I doubt the scientists, engineers, and factory workers who created my computer care that I'm using their technology to write this, nor will they ever see it. 

Even if I decide to print this out, all I have to do is click a few buttons, and the ink gets automatically lazored onto a sheet of paper, no need for a compositor.

But what do we lose when our creative work drifts away from the manual processes that allow it to exist? What are the consequences of this division? 

I thought about this as I struggled to find the right space to finish off the last line of my printing job. I wasn't very good at setting type, as evidenced by the upside down ampersands and backwards b's in my finished print. I also wasn't great at operating the press, not quite able to pump my foot with the right speed and power at the right time. Did these errors completely ruin my print? No. Did it change my relationship to the work? Of course. 

In Lisa Gietlman's piece, “Print Culture (Other Than Codex): Job Printing and Its Importance," she writes:

> "Today, even the printer’s hand has gone missing, because we have “become accustomed to speaking or writing of ‘printers’ not as people, but as machines” connected to our computers (McKitterick 2003, 1)." (Gietleman, 185)

I find Gietlman's reference to "the printer's hand" interesting. Shouldn't the mark of a successful printer be their ability to be forgotten? No errors, no distracting layout choices, only a composition that allows the content to be the star. But as I was making these choices in the print shop (what spaces to use, what font to use) I gained a better appreciation for the art of printing. The book isn't finished when the author stops writing it. The process of producing the book, either physically printing it or publishing it digitally, is as much of an art as is the drafting of the content. When you consider the labor of printers and publishers to be also inherently intellecutal and creative, not just phsycially laboreous, as in the case of scribes and print culture of the 1800s, you gain a more total understanding of the book as a medium, an object, and a piece of information.
