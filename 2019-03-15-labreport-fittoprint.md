Over the past 30 years, journalism has shifted radically through key historical moments, most noteably, the birth of the 24 hour news cycle and the emergence of computer-mediated news. As much as the ways in which we make and consme news has changed in the later half of the 20th century, many of the trappings of 19th century journalism can still be seen in modern reporting. 

At first glance, *the Bethlehem Daily Times* from December 21st, 1876 seems like a relic of another time. The paper itself is huge, with only one section, no pictures, no headlines, and with tiny print packed in to every column. 

Additionally, one of the first things that I noticed was that the acutal news was delegated to one tiny column, written in list form, with only small bits of information about each event.

At first, I marked this as a major difference between 19th century and today's news. But then I realized, a lot of the time I only read the headlines of stories, when I don't have the time or interest in delving in to a full report. Then I went on *the New York Times* website and remembered that on their homepage, a lot of the most important stories have a bullet list of the key information about an event.

This is almost exactly like *the Bethlehem Times*. Information has always been packaged for easy consumtion by humans. In James Gleick's *The Information*, he writes about how memes, or bits of information that are reproduced and replicated, survive in a Darwinian idea economy. He writes:

>"They compete with one another for limited resources: brain time or bandwidth. They compete most of all for *attention*." (312)

The only difference here is that when you click on one of these links on the *NYT*, it leads to a full news story, including pictures and other media, links to more information, and most importantly, the byline.

This for me was the major difference between todays news and that of 1876. In *the Bethlehem News*, there isn't a single attribution or listed author.

The reader just has to trust that the information they are reading is true and unbiased based on the reputation of the news organization itself. Today, knowing who wrote a piece of news and where the information came from is one of the most crucial ways a reader can parse out the good reporting from the bad, the true news from the fake. 

In their essay on "fugitive poetry," or anonymous poems often reprinted in 19th century newspapers, Cordell and Mullen write: 

>"As Weir and Lorang show, 'anonymity â€¦ was a fundamental characteristic of nineteenth-century American literary culture,' far more common to popular poetry than our current bibliographies and anthologies reflect, and often reflective of complex authorial assemblages that cannot be reduced to a single writer."

A major different of 19th century news was that authorship wasn't always as neat as it is today. Because elements of newspapers were sometimes reprinted in other papers, this authorship was harder to trace. What did this imply, then, for readers and their trust in the news? 

A comparasion could be drawn to news agrigated on social media. Often, because of the ease in which posts can be spread, their information becomes decontextualized and somewhat divorced from their original authors. But if this has always been a problem, is there anything we can do about it? *Should* we do anything about it? The answers might be murky, but a good defence against the consequences that come with these problems of trust and authorship could lie in the reader. While newspapers absolutely have a responsibilty to print objective facts, we can't expect this of all publishers. Readers should equip themselves by reading with a critical eye, knowing the difference between the good news and the bad, and being wary of information spread online that can't be easily traced to a reputable source.
