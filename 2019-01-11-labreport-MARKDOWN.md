# MARKDOWN AND MEDIA

It's a moving feeling when we can look behind the proverbial curtain to see the great and powerful forces that create and control the objects and interfaces we encounter everyday. Admittedly, I rarely consider the kind of work, skill, and history that lays silently behind my youtube videos, my online newsfeeds, and any other webpage I have ever visited. As Lisa Gitelman wrote in *Media as Historical Subjects,* "the success of all media depends at some level on inattention or 'blindness' to the media technologies themselves."  

I've always felt intimidated by the mysterious, unembellished raw code that makes up my computer, more comfortable simply enjoying the content presented to me without a thought to the medium in which it is contained. But learning how to write in Markdown has changed my whole perspective on digital technology. 

Markdown, a simple markup language that's easy to learn and easy to convert into other formats, uses specific syntax that lets the user easily embed links, images, video, HTML, and format their work.

**this is bold**

Coincidentally, that's also how I feel when I use Markdown in public and pretend to be a hacker. 

Anyone can learn Markdown. And it feels empowering, especially for those of us who are not as tech-savvy or code-literate, to be able to have some semblance of understanding and control over the medium through which our digital lives unfold. I've even started to use Markdown for my to-do lists, school assignments, and anything I would have used Microsoft Word for previously (sorry Bill). 

Not only is it fun and empowering to use Markdown, but it's *important* to have this meaningful (albeit small) connection to digital technology. We are all aware of how enormous a role the Internet plays in our daily lives, our entertainment, our communication, and our identities. But, as Marshal McLuhan writes in *The Medium is the Message*, 

>*"It is the medium that shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action."*

When operating in digital spaces, everywhere from the President's twitter to my Dad's facebook, we are bound by the code that comprises the Internet. Without us even realizing, it dictates all of our interactions, those with content and those with each other. And the Internet, with the programs, logic, and numbers that make it work, also carries a social history. This history is reflected in every new step we take into the digital world. From helping us [beat the Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine), to launching the career of [Justin Bieber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOFRZ1wNLw_), computers have evolved with us.  And they will continue to evolve, but in knowing and understanding computation and the languages of the Internet, we can have a more intimate influence on the direction they are going.
