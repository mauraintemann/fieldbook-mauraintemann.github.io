In Ted Chiang's "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling," two intertwining stories help to explore the idea that "the pursuit of truth ceased to be an intrinsic good," (6) when language -- and, by proxy, memory -- moved from oral and momentary to written and recorded. Chiang crafts this narrative through a story from the past in conversation with a story from the future. But this piece left me thinking, where are we now? And can we ever return to a pre-written ontology? 

James Gleick's *The Information* helps shed light on the nature of this switch. Calling on the beliefs of scholar Eric Havelock, he writes: 

>"Havelock focused on the process of converting, mentally from a 'prose of narrative' to a 'prose of ideas;" organizing experience in terms of categories rather than events; embracing the discipline of abstraction. He had a word in mind for this process, and the word was *thinking*. This was the discovery, not just of the self, but of the *thinking* self -- in effect, the true beginning of consciousness." (37)

This quote delivers us at an understanding of where we are now. Writing helped us to capture and create ideas in a fundamentally different manner than before. But what writing could not capture, a unique affordance of the pre-written state of being, was the natural ability of thought to live and breathe and evolve. In the story of  Jijingi, Chiang writes: 

>“I’m not asking the clan to trust me. I’m asking them to trust the men who were elders when you were young.”
>>“And so they should. But those men aren’t here. All you have is paper.” 

>“The paper tells us what they would say if they were here.”
>“Does it? A man doesn’t speak only one thing." (28)

Now, we ask *the records* themselves to speak for those whose momentary stories and truthes were contained in them. And because this switch changed the basic way with think about the world and ourselves, we may never be able to return.
