In the nineteenth century, the term "fugitive poem" descriped poetry that was often "serial, circulatory, and recursive," that was printed in newspapers. Some poems, with frequently anonymous or disputed authors, would be so ubiquitous that they even garnered parodies and remixes. In  “'Fugitive Verses’: The Circulation of Poems in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers," Cordell and Mullen write:

> "The term “fugitive” insists that poems within the ex-change system should have authors—or owners—but that the newspaper’s mate-rial and social operations undermine such controls."

With these kinds of poems, the content was often so divorced from any real or substanial attribution that the poems were free to circulate virally, often taking on different transfigurations along as they were disseminated. These "fugitive poems" embody the kind of memetic behavior descriped by James Gleick in "The Information." To put it simply, he writes: "The meme is not the dance but the dance." He also writes: "They are entities with interests that can be furthered by natural selection. Their interests are not out interests." Essentially, memes are the bits of ideas that compete for virality in a natural selection of attention. But how does the example of fugitive poems complicate this idea? How are memes and poems ever completely divorced of their originators?
