In Lauren J. Young, Daniel Peterschmidt, and Cat Frazier's "File Not Found Series," they unpack one of the most strongly-held myths of the digital age -- that the Internet is forever. Just as libaries burn down, old cassettes become obsolete, and magnetic tape files degrade, the digital filing systems of the web are material, and come with the same vulnerabilites as record-keepers of the past. 

Young describes the ways in which librarians, archivists, and researchers are working to find a way to make digital records more permanent. This kind of work is incredibly important when it comes to power over and access to information. But there's also an implicit goal at the heart of this project.

>"The quest for immortal data manifests from the same reason we save old artifacts, personal keepsakes, and family heirlooms. It comes from our desire to transcend time, to live on in some shape or form through the objects we leave behind."

Our species is obsessed with reaching beyond the scope of our own lifetimes. Why else would we send out a Chuck Berry record on the Voyager probes? It's exciting to imagine the things we create living beyond our tiny stays on earth. But why? Lacking actual immortality, libraries and space probes are the closest we can get to living forever.
