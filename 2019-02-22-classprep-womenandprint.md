In "Women Compositers," Emily Faithfull writes about the Victoria Press and why its objectors believe that women are ruining the profession and rate of wages in printing. She writes, "I can only say, that either the female mind is mechanical, or that printing does not require a mechanical mind -- for that women *can* print there is no doubt." The Victoria Press, as well as other printers, publishers and writers (as noted by Sarah Werner in "Finding women in the printing shop"), were proof that women could be and *were* sucessful in the field of printing. 

M.M.H.'s description of the ladies' printing house involved neat carpets and "suitably furnished" rooms, with an "air of business and refinemnet." I found this a humorous juxataposition from Benjamin Franklin's description of the printing house, which involved burly, roudy men sloshing beers around and flexing their muscles. But how different were these places really? And how did these differences affect the work they did?
