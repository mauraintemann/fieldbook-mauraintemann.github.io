I was charmed by Sydney Padua's graphic novel, *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*. I really enjoyed the way she weaves real facts and anecdotes into these entertaining and educational stories. I feel like graphic novels have a bad rap as being sophmoric and unserious, but I think this one proves those stereotypes wrong. Not only is it entertaining, but I felt like I really learned a lot, making it accessable for both childen and adults alike. 

I particularly enjoyed the "Endnotes" on page 81, where Padua talks about the Analytical Engine and the Jacquard Loom. It was interesting to see a break down of the actual mechanics that went into the Analytical Engine. This reminded me very much of Gutenberg's Printing Press, and how so many different parts and technologies and mechanisms had to be invented in order for the entire machine to come to fruition. For the Analytical Engine, three different kinds of punch cards worked together to run a program, calling on Jacquard's "Loom," the progression of which Babbage studied. This is a great example of how a single inquiry into technology can spur a drove of innovation and development, and that no one innovation is created within a vacuum.
