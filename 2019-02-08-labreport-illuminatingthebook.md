For most of us today, candlelight is less of a utility (besides during power outages) and more of a decoration, something we indulge ourselves with during bubble baths, yoga sessions, and romantic encounters. But historically, candles were *the* utility -- a more elegant, honed expression of man's greatest discovery of fire. The candle allowed us to have control over our schedules for the first time, our circadian rythms no longer tied to the sun. More control meant more time, more time meant more stuff to do, like writing. 

While we wrote by candlelight during our lab, I couldn't help but feel an element of intimacy in the air. My personal understanding of this medium as something romantic and special seeped into my experience of transcribing. I imagine this was quite similar to the experience of a medieval scribe. While we both felt the eye strain, back pain, and the other tribulations of copying by candlelight, I also imagine the scribe had their own set of feelings, accumlated by expereince, about candlelight. Instead of thinking about the relaxing haze of a candle-lit spa, perhaps they implicitly felt the historical, utilitarian importance of candlelight, the finite measure of available burning wax adding to the seriousness of their work.  

Obviously, candles, and later the electric lightbulb, represented an enormous change for society, allowing for a richer pursuit of knowledge and control over our world. But this change was not without its pains. Messages from scribes written in the margins of their manuscripts, reveal the kind of distress and drudgery they undertook abetted by candlelight. In *The Information*, James Gleick considers the ways in which our understanding of information describes and constructs reality. 

>"This is another way of fathoming the paradox of the observer: that the outcome of an experiment is affected, or even determined, when it is observed. Not only is the observer observing, she is asking questions and making statements that must utlimately be expressed in discrete bits." (10)

Essentially, we create reality when we communicate it, when we translate experience into information. And with all the progress and pain that came along with the candle, it ultimately allowed us, quite literally, to observe ourselves and our world in a deeper way. And, by Gleick's logic, it allowed reality, as we knew and created it, to unfold.  

The candle existed outside of the media it illuminated, but it singularly made it possible for that media to be written, transcribed, and disseminated. Today, we are still surrounded by "media adjacent" technologies. One which I'm sure most of us use everyday is a pair of headphones. This piece of technology allows for us to experience a wealth of media, from music to movies to podcasts. Before the 50's, headphones were mostly used by people in the military and telecommunications. But when headphones were first sold to the public, they completely changed the way we listen to audio, and utlimately changed what was possible in terms of audio media. The advent of headphones meant that you could have an individual listening experience, and when used in tandem with a radio, meant that you could listen anywhere. 

But how did this change the content we create and listen to? I'm a big fan of podcasts, and I would argue that podcasts would not exist without headphones. Granted, media like radio plays were extremely popular before the era of popular headphone use, but there was always a specific time and place one would have to listen, not to mention the looming possibility of ambient noise and ambient *people.* Podcasts can be lengthy, nuanced, and experimental in ways that were not possible pre-headphone. As James Gleick writes, "the new channel does more than extend the previous channel. It enables reuse and 'recollection' - new modes. It permits whole new architectures of information." (32) The experience of individual listening allowed for by headphones is something that has fundamentally restructred our daily lives and industries of media creation, even our senses of self. Rarely do I walk anywhere without popping my headphones in, if only to signal to others that I'm indeed engaged in my own world, rather than lamenting that I'm alone. These technologies, like headphones and candles, change the way we observe the world, the way we experience information, and the way we create reality.
