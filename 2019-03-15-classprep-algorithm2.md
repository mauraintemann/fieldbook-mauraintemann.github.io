In Scott B. Weingart's essay, “The Route of a Text Message," he attempts to explain the technical processes at work behind the sending of a single text message -- in this case, one that says "I love you," from his wife. Personally, most of this essay flew straight over my head, save for some bits about wavelengths and LED lights. I do believe that computer literacy is so important, and will only increase cooperation among STEM and humanities, but I'm curious if this kind of literacy, regarding the actual physics and engineering of cellular communications, is something that *everyone* needs to have. In “The Beauty of Code,” Vikram Chandra writes: 

>" This longing for architectural coherence leads to comparisons of code with music, which is often described as the most mathematical of the arts."

I think computer literacy could be seen almost like music literacy. Some people are professionals, and perform music for a living. But that doesn't mean that a non-musician can't pick up the guitar as a hobby. The comparasion is a bit flawed, as I think the consequences of lacking computer literacy are a lot more serious than not being able to play an instrument. But I think seeing it like this can help bridge the gap between those who code and those who don't, but might want to.
