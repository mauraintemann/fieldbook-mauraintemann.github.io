Octave Uzanne is eerily prophetic in "The End of Books," where he writes about how print books will be replaced by new technology --the phonograpy -- and that works of authorship will be auditory. The illustration, "Phonographic Literature for the Promenade" is strikingly similar to those of us who walk around with our headphones in. At one point, he writes:

>"Our eyes are made to see and reflect the beauties of nature, and not to wear themselves out in the reading of texts; they have been too long abused."

This is an interesting line in light of our current sentiments about book reading. Many believe that reading books (rather than listening to them, watching them as movies, playing them) is inherently more valuable, intellectual, and productive. As someone who listens to a lot more podcasts and audiobooks than I read actual books, I found this part heartening. I also found it to be almost a nice middleman between the time when "novel reading" was considered poison, to current times, when book reading is almost fetishized. 

In the movie about the NYT's last day of linotype, you can see a similar progression. From Gutenberg's press, to linotype, to computer printing, these are pivotal moments in history that seem unprecedented at the time. I like the last line of the move:

>"But despite automation, computerization, and tech continuaing advances of electronics, the central factor is still the work of a human brain, the work of human eyes, and the work of human hands."

This is a poignant way to ease the pain of these drastic changes. But how is this idea complicated with our current innovations in A.I. and technology, where often the work of the human brain is obscured or purged altogether?
