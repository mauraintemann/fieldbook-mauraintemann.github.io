In "How to Read like a Renaissance Reader," Adam Hooks describes a method of reading that's not unlike how many students are encouraged to handle their coursework today. All the time, students are asked to "actively engage with the text." By the time students enter higher education, many of us adopt the highlight/markup style of reading. I rarely approach texts without at least a pen. Besides helping me remember key ideas from the piece when I go back to read it, marking up a text helps me process the information as I'm consuming it. Sometimes this includes underlining words I don't know and highlighting certain phrases I'm not sure how to interpret. James Gleick writes in *The Information*, "Definition is communication: making another understand; sending a message." (60) The message of a texts is often contained in verbose, vague, or technical language. Sometimes meaning is laiden in even the simplest of words, but hidden in an obscure context. Understanding language, and actively reading into the language of a text, is the key to unlocking its message, what the author is trying to communicate. 

Hooks also brings to our attention a third aspect of active reading (besides reading and marking up), a reader must "put into practice what you have read and marked -- that is, you must *use* what you have read." This is an important step, one that solidifies the laborious process of understanding and learning. But how did this process change in the era of the printing press? How is the act of close, active reading supported by this invention, which lead to wider dissemination of books, wider readership, and consequently wider opportunity for interpretation?
