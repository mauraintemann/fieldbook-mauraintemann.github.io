#The Book as Object

In chapter one of Amaranth Borsuk's *the Book*, she describes the history of the book as an object, as well as the features of formatting and print that evolved over time into the conventions we are familiar with today. Forms of writing and recording developed and shifted in popular use based largely on what Borsuk refers to as the "desires of a hypothetical readership." It was (and continues to be) the audience that determines what is valued and required in a literary object, and therefore also the audience that determines the direction in which those objects evolve. Readers and consumers inform the "affordances" of an object, or "the possibilites for use presented by its form [that] fascilitate certain kinds of expression. The clay tablet allowed for a durable, portable means of record-keeping. Papyrus allowed for a medium that was flexible and adaptable to its content. Each object had their affordances, but they also had their imperfections, which shaped future iterations of literary technology.   
Today, a large portion of information is communicated through audio, as Borsuk mentions. Ebooks and Podcasts afford their users with a hands-free, eyes-free reading experience. These forms communicate what many of us value -- easy listening, freedom to multitask, and sense of control over what we consume. But even our objects will seem miniscule and archaic when we look back from the future. What are the imperfections of our forms that will give way to the next generation of literary objects?
