Boisâ€™ use of video and text chat in his story, 17776, also known as What Football Will Like in the Future, embraces and explores the full potential of Internet literature, imploring readers to consider ways in which technology can be used for storytelling. Technology itself is an omnipresent theme in 17776, a story told mostly from the point of view of sentient space probes.

Some decry this genre of interactive, multi-media literature, a genre in which the line between reading and playing is decidedly blurred. In Amaranth Borsuk's "The Book as Interface," she writes:

>"While digital reading interfaces like the Kindle and Nook aim to pour texts written for print into digital vesels, some writers are developing books specifically for the affordances of networked, screen-based devices, incorporating video, sound animation, and complex layout." (245)

These affordances are somewhat unique to their digital media. But despite those who consider these features to be a step too far away from the traditional realm of literature, media has always changed as new forms offer meaningful affordances within a cultural or historical moment. The codex itself gained popularity over the scroll because of its portability, speaking to a burgeoning readership. If we object to every new innovation  in media, we forget that what we consider traditional was once revolutionary.
