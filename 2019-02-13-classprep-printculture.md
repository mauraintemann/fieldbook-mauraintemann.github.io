In "Print Culture (Other Than Codex)," Lisa Gitelman writes about the rise of the career of the printer and the culture surrounding print publishing. One quote that resonated with me was when Gitelman gestures to our modern conception of "print culture," which is drastically different from the print culture of Gutenberg and Franklin. 

>Any textual artifact that is not handwritten or otherwise handmade letter by letter (such as by typing) counts as “printed,” while today, even the printer’s hand has gone missing, because we have “become accustomed to speaking or writing of ‘printers’ not as people, but as machines” connected to our computers. (184)

We tend to think of printers as being divorced from the editorial process, the content of the book. But historically, the printer's impact could be felt in the printed codex as much as could the author's. In Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, he writes at length about a periodical he read, *The Spectator*. He writes about his diligent process of reading and rereading, memorizing, and imitating the words in writing. I thought this process was similar to that of the printer, who had to be someone accutely aware of words and language of a specific volume. This relationship of the printer to the text harkens back to the scribe, who sat copying religious texts, treating them with a similar reverence. Is this still true today? Or is the printer now completely dissocnnected from the content they produce?
