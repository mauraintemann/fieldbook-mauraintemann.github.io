Today, most readers don't give a thought to the materiality of books, but rather see the content of the book as an immaterial entity. Content is so divorced from the idea of a book as a physical object that even when we read an ebook, listen to an audiobook, or consume text in some other non-codex form, we still call them books. 

Having hands-on experience setting type in the letterpress gives a unique glimpse into this relationship between content and object. When setting type, even spaces become objects. Leads are angled, molded objects, so physical that evidence of their existence lingers on the setter's fingers. The type is backward and upside down; it's only when the type is joined together, held by pressure, covered in ink and pressed into paper that it reveals its content. And even then, the content is in the impression rather than the type. 

In *The Book*, Amaranth Borsuk explores the rift between content and materiality. She writes: 

>"Even though numerable material elements come together to make the book, these features have been naturalized to such a degree that we now hardly notice them." (109)

In order to enjoy a book, a reader needs to ignore the physical elements of the text and of their own situation. We often talk about books as portals to fictional worlds, immersive experiences. For this magic to work, the reader must put aside that they're on the train or sitting in their living room, and they especially must put aside that the words they hold in their hands are just ink impressions from metal. 

The last lines of *A Printer's Epitaph* captures the difference between type (as well as the other material elements of print culture) and content.

> Whose *impress* is the spiritâ€™s deathless *page;*
Worn out, the *type* is thrown to *pi* again,
The *impression* lives through an eternal age.

Despite being a humorous poem loaded with printing puns, it also illustrates the idea that type, bound by its materiality, has no fundamental content. Type is scrambled and scattered and reassembled to form thousands of words in thousands of texts. But the impressions they make become content that seems released from the physical realm, imbued with a mystic, eternal life beyond the page.
