With the advent of the printing press came the decline of the art of copying and the lessened importance of the scribe. But prior to this change, scribes had a meaningful place in the processes of writing and publishing texts. As Johannes Trithemius wrote in *In Praise of Scribes*, "Greater is the piety of the scribe than that of the preacher; the preacher's warning perishes with time, but the scribe's pronouncements will last for many years." The simple act of writing is a powerful one, carrying a different, more precise kind of permanance than that of speaking. Even further, Trithemius praises the physical durability of parchment manuscripts as opposed to that of paper books.  
 
But not lost is the important art of translation, still relevent today. As Ælfric underscores in his preface to Genesis, translation is "dangerous," due to the opportunities for errors and their consequences. The consequences mentioned by Ælfric revolve around the false translation of religious texts leading to misinterpretation of God's law, a heinous sin. But as literature changed over time, so did the consequences of translation mistakes. I remember the first time I read my favorite book, *The Stranger*. I was using a copy from the library, and I didn't think to take note of what translation I was reading. I have since been unable to find the exact version I read, which included a very specific line that simply does not have the same emotion or power as any other translations I've read since. As readerships expanded and genre evolved, translation affected not just the meaning of a work, but also its tone, meter, and aesthetic.
