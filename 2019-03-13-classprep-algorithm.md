In chapters 4-6 of James Gleick's "The Information," he writes about the transformations that came to media and electric communications with the development of new technologies and mathematical theorums. He uses a quote from Vannevar Bush to discuss the purpose of machines like Babbage's Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, which aimed to eliminate the "wasteful labor of mere calculation." Bush said: 

>"A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgement." (172)

Gleick continues on to write about how developing technologies at the time targeted this higher plane, where machines could parse out logical problems and paradoxes, not just complete simple number problems. Glieck writes about "the liar's paradox," where a statement is both false and true at the same time. 

>"The discovery of this twisting, backfiring, mind-bending circularity does not bring life or language crashing to a halt - one graps the idea and moves on - because life and language lack the perfection, the absolutes, that give them force." (179)

This quote stuck with me. Today, A.I. seem to be demonstrating real intelligence, certainly capable of completing complicated tasks and performing certain behaviors that seem to lie on a higher plane of technology. But in a world of imperfection and paradox, can machines ever fully "move on," from these circular problems, to understand them as unsolveable, we do in the real world?
