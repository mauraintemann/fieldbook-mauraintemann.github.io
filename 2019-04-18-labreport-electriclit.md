In this class, we've talked a lot about the "affordances" of certain media, and on many occasions delved into the specific affordances of electronics in the realms of litearture, storytelling, and communication. For example, the Internet is a space which is singular in how it allows for unprecedented connectivity, collaboration, and access; not to mention it introduces an entire new set of tools which authors can employ in mixed media art and writing. 

To further exemplify this point, a work that immediately comes to mind is Jon Bois' “What Football Will Look Like in the Future." Combining images, video, animation, this piece is a poster child for electronic literature, especially in that its meaning and purpose are not at all divorced from its form. Its story could not be told in any other way. 

In Marshall McLuhan's "Medium is the Message," he writes:

> "Let us return to the electric light. Whether the light is being used for brain surgery or night baseball is a matter of indifference. It could be argued that these activities are in some way the 'content' of the electric light, since they could not exist without the electric light. This fact merely underlines the point that 'the medium is the message' because it is the medium that shapes and controls the scale
and form of human association and action."

Similarly, circuits, electric light, and other tech-y stuff comes together in your computer for you to be able to read "What Football Will Look Like in the Future." In this case, the medium is the message because it allows for the content to exist. But there are more explicit examples of something like light as both the medium and the message, but that also constitutes the totality of the piece. 

In the 1960's, artists started experimenting with flourescent and neon lights in sculptures and installations. Perhaps the most famous of this movement is the work of Dan Flavin, who combined minimalism and fluorescence in his work.

Here, in his piece, *Untitled (to Ileana and Michael Sonnabend)*, a single flourescent lighting tube colors the walls pink and blue, while casting shadows that create soft forms.  

What I like about Flavin's work is that it takes traditional conceptions of color and gradient into a physical space. Compare Flavin's light installations to Miya Ando's *Untitled*.

Ando uses paint within the confines of a 2D canvas (in this case, the canvas is actually sheets of aluminum) to create similar fields of gradient light and color. In Flavin's work, light is both the medium and the message, and it overcomes the spatial constrains of Ando's work by taking making the art into the 3rd dimension. 

In our lab, we used paper circuits to create works of art. For my lab project, I used light to illuminate a doodle.

Using the conductive tape and LED lights was pretty easy after a brief learning curve and some help. Just like how Flavin's work uses light as a medium, in place of paint or charcoal, light colors my doodle for me. But as the project, “21st Century Notebooking," from Nexmap explains, this very simple technology can also be used in works of literature. They show the possibilities for taking light and electronics into a physical space for journals and storytelling. They write:

>"Using simple materials like copper tape, surface mount LEDs and batteries, you can light up your notebook to literally highlight your personal light bulb moments."

While Jon Bois uses electric light to tell his story online, paper circuits take mixed media storytelling into a physical space for literature, much like Flavin used electric light to remove the spatial constraints of traditional fine art. 

Yet again, as consistent with other units during this course, these ideas deliver us to a point that marries the humanities with the sciences. By viewing light and electricity not soley as a medium, but as the medium, message, and the content, opens the doors for multimedia storytelling in an offline context.
