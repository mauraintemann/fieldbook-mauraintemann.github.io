In Stephen Fry's "Machines that Made Us," he delves deep into the life and inventions of Johannes Gutenberg, the most principle invention being that of the printing press. But what Fry helps to illuminate is all the other subordinate pieces and inventions Gutenberg had to develop in order for his vision to be realized. 

What struck me most was the creation of so many new professions necessitated by the printing press. We tend to think that the advent of the printing press, like so many history-changing machines, brought on the elimination of antiquated jobs, like the scribe and the illuminator. But scriveners didn't simply disappear altogether, nor did illuminators. And the printing press allowed for new jobs in type foundries and paper mills. And although, as Amaranth Borsuk writes, "we no longer sense the hand of the scribe or craftsman when we pick up a mass market paperback," (76) modern readers can still appreciate the lasting impact, albeit abstracted, of those historical craftsmen, in the subtle vestiges that lay within the physical body and formatting of the codex.
