In Emily St. John Mandel's *Station Eleven*, she tells the story of the apocolypse, and as the Internet and all electronics are no longer functioning, she followes one group of actors and musicians who travel around performing Shakespeare. As Mandel shifts between stories of before the collapse and after, she brings up themes about performances and ephemera in the digital age. In a flashback to a story about actor Arthur Leander and an old friend, she writes:

>"The restaurant was one of those large, under-lit places that seemed to recede into shadow at the periphery, andin the mury middle distance Clark saw a pinpoint of green light that meant someone was recording Arthur on a cell phone...[Arthur] was performing. Clark has thought he was meeting his oldest friend for dinner, but Arthur wasn't having dinner with a friend, Clark realized, so much as having dinner with an audience." (112)

In the time after the collapse of society, artistic performance lives on. But lacking the kind of electronic infrastructure of the world today, the nature of performance and of celebrity changes. In what way does being surrounded by recording devices and these external repositories of memory convert our every day lives into performances?
