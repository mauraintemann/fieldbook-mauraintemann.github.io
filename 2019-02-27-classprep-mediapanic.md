Many of the 18th century qualms against novel reading seem to revolve around their content, the overconsumption of which many argued would cause the reader to lose touch with reality, or lose an apetite for hardier fare. This comes in the cultural moment when fiction and novels strayed far from the bulk of print culture in terms of their style and goals. Today, as Anna North notes in her article for the Times, there is a similar "disourse on young men and video games." 

The media panic of novels in the 18th century is similar to that of video games now, we tend to worry that their users are addicted, that the content somehow degrades their intelligence. In retrospect, we praise the reading of novels and books as opposed to e-reading or other digital activities. But how different is the content of these media? Video games often have character arcs, plot, and other trappings of narrative media. So is the issue with the mechanical consumption of the content, the action one must take in order to consume it? Misgivings about novels had less to do with the "highly wrought" depiction of reality which people claimed would cause young people to have wrong expectations about life, and more to do with the medium itself, and the fear around new technology that seems to be inevitable.
