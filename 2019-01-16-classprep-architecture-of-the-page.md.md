#Architecture of the Page 


In Chapter 1 of Bonnie Mak's *How the Page Matters*, she explores how the idea of the "page" was conceptualized and evolved throughout history. As she analyzes the implications of the "four edges of the page," which prescribe what can be contained within the page, she writes: "There is nothing more to be read than what is on the page"(7). In order to fully and acurately capture the truth of Mak's project, I would emend this statement to: *There is nothing more to read than what is* within *the page*.

This notion, fleshed out by Marshall McLuhan in *The Medium is the Message*, describes how the medium through which content is delivered is also content in itself. The page, as well as carrying whatever information is etched onto it, implicitly conveys the social history of mankind, as Mak explains through her mapping of the "page" from *papyrus* to *computer screen.* For example, Mak writes about the importance of the papyrus crop, whose reeds "could be made into a pliable material for writing, while other parts of the plant were harvested for food and medicine, or used in clothing, baskets, ropes, boats, and sails" (3) There are certain implications of placing *writing* next to food, medicine, and clothing, on a hierarchy of survival. The importance of literacy and record keeping as a matter of survival is a continuous narrative that remains attached to the page, and interacts with the explicit content contained within it.
