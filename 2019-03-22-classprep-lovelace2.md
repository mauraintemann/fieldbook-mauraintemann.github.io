I really enjoyed the story of *The Thrilling Adventures* called "Mr. Boole Comes to Tea." In the simple, three-page comic, Padua cleverly expresses the basis of "Boolean Expression," which is a foundational part of modern computing and programming langauges. Padua writes: 

>"He reduced all possible logical conditions down to two states: true or false, yes or no -- expressed as 0 and 1; and three relationships: AND (multiplication, OR (addition), NOT (negation)." (210)

This description in the end-notes seems straight forward, and obviously makes logical sense. But the way Padua shows Boole acually using Boolean Expression in the comic as he is trying to communicate with the butler raises interesting questions about the nature of language, as well as the practical applications of the Analytical Engine (and the potential of a Thinking Machine). Can language really be expressed by logic and math in a way that is truthful to how language functions in real life? Boolean expression makes sense for inquiries that have a definite answer, yes or no. But when the butler asks the simple question of "*How* do you want your tea?" Boole seizes up. What elements of language make it hard to express in this way?
