In "How Typeface Influences the Way we Think," Chris Gayomali expresses an important idea that he explores through a discusison of how different fonts affect the way we read and think about a text. He writes:

"Words hold power. But the aesthetic manner in which those words are presented can affect the way we read, and the way we think about the information presented."

As Gayomali discusses, typeface is a good way to illustrate this idea. The subtle differences in fonts can have deep impacts on how readers react to and understand text. Fonts are sometimes an afterthought, not given the weight they deserve in the editorial process. But this is not the only unstated aesthetic choice that has a huge affect on reading. Lindsay Lynch writes about the affect of spaces on reading. It's hard to imagine text without spaces, but it's something writers and publishers barely give a thought to. But thinking about these factors in the context of the letterpress, they become hugely tangible issues.
